# Great Par, Bryher
## Sheds of renowned gigs, worked by rival groups of pilots

The _Czar_ is the only historic gig on Scilly that has never been kept away from the islands, and continues to be rowed and raced here today (Tresco & Bryher Gig Rowing Club website) (**Photos 1** & **2**). Built by Peters in 1879, she was originally fitted for seven oars; a Victorian renewal of an old St Mawes tradition, reaching back 400 years, of 7- or even 8-oared gigs, banned in Georgian times for their potential for use by smugglers to evade excise vessels **link to Project Page**.

_Czar_ was formerly kept at Great Par, or Porth. Gig sheds once stood in three places, spaced around the north half of the par, serving rival pilotage concerns (**Photo 3**). Dispersed sheds (or clusters of them) elsewhere, as at Peraskin, St Agnes, may again have belonged to different shareholding groups. Sheds were also placed to make use of the relative shelter afforded by corners of beaches.

The old _Czar_ shed is now a Scheduled Monument. This low site is especially vulnerable to the sea. It has sand and stones cast up on it, and boulders placed on its front to keep the waves back. The _Porths and Gigs_ plan, made with the help of volunteer trainee Layan Harman, shows the long walls, and the lack of an inner end wall due to the unusual use of double doors at each end (**Photos 4** and **5**). Slipways alongside and in front served the two ends (**Photos 6** and **7**).

The roof survived until *c*1960, appearing in a rare close-up photo (**Photo 8**). It was thatched with rushes or reeds from pools and inlets (Chris Potterton, pers. comm.). It appears to have had bundles of thatch not fully secured by a rope net in the traditional way (as seen in the 1862 painting on the front website page), probably because they represent repair late in the lifetime of the shed.

In the 1960s the _Czar_ was kept in the _Eagle_ shed to its south, which was roofed with thatch, then tiles, then corrugated iron, before being restored with tiles on conversion to a studio (Nick Jenkins, Richard Pearce and David Stedeford, pers. comms.). Red ‘Double Roman’ tiles are traditional, being used on Scilly from before 1800; they were shipped from Bridgwater, Somerset (**Photo 9**).

To the north is the site of the double shed of the 1844 gig _Albion_, and probably the _March_ (Richard Jenkins, pers. comm.). The shed is not apparent now on the ground, but is unforgettable as the site from which an astonishing rescue was carried out in 1871 (**Photos 10** and **11**).

_11: Former site of the double shed of the _Albion_ and probably _March_, to the north on Great Porth (thanks to Richard Jenkins for information). These sheds were those from which the gigs were carried nearly half a mile, even before the rescuers left Bryher, to save lives from the sea in 1871._

The Liverpool steamer _Delaware_ foundered near Mincarlo, west of Samson, in a foul winter gale (_Cornish Telegraph_, December 27 1871, 2-3). A Bryher crew carried their gig (identified by local tradition as _Albion_) from here to Rushy Bay at the south end of the island, pulled across to Samson, carried _Albion_ across the Neck of Samson, launched again into ‘furious waves, shoulder-deep’, and pulled on westward to White Island, to reach the two survivors who’d been driven there from the wreck on a broken lifeboat.

The _Albion_ crew pulled back to Samson, wrapped the men in ferns as well as some of their own clothing, and swaysed (signalled by waving a jacket) from North Hill for the _March_ to pull across from Bryher. They then pulled the _March_ back to Bryher, taking the two survivors to be cared for in the nearest house. (The _March_ crew later carried _Albion_ back across Samson from West Porth before returning home.)

The _Albion_ men who achieved this humanitarian feat were Richard Ellis, James Jenkin, junior, Stephen Woodcock, and John Webber; William Woodcock, William Jenkin, John Jacob Jenkin, Thomas Bickford, and Sampson Jenkin, and cox’n Patrick Trevillick, aged 21 to 50. (The _Porths and Gigs_ project report gives more details, from the contemporary accounts.)

The OS map of 1888, highly accurate and detailed, marks a feature at the north end of Great Porth, with a position, orientation, and span consistent with its being the landward gable end of one half of the double shed. This would fit with the memory on Bryher of a ruined wall having been visible at that shed site through the 20th century (Richard Pearce, pers. comm.).

It is not clear if anything now remains at the double shed site. Comparing the modern map and the 1888 survey, it appears that the gable left in 1888 may have stood just behind the line of the modern sea defences (where the ground has been dug out and then built up higher with rock armour) ─ so there could be some possibility of survival of the base of that gable.

The panorama seen from the _Czar_ shed site takes in the hazardous rocks in the open sea beyond, including Mincarlo near which the _Delaware_ struck (the islet with undulating profile, on the skyline beyond the south side of the opening of the porth) and the taller, steeper Castle Bryher.
