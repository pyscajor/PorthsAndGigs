# Porths and Gigs of the Isles of Scilly
## 3D models derived from 3D survey

Photogrammetry (Structure from Motion - SfM) surveys were undertaken at the sites listed in the 3D directory of the *Porths and Gigs* repository. Photos were processed using Agisoft Metashape. The 3D models presented online have been decimated from their high resolution datasets into a resolution suitable for disseminating via Sketchfab and GitHub.

At the time of writing (February 2025), the future of Sketchfab is uncertain, and so the 3D files uploaded there are included here as an alternative.

3D models are in Wavefront *.obj* format and contain a texture file in JPEG *.jpg* format. These are compressed into a Zip file. These files should open or import into most 3D software.

The NeRF data, recording the setting of the sites at Great Par, Bryher, and New Quay, St Mary's, has been converted to Gaussian Splatting point cloud data. It is presented here as a Stanford *.ply* file. 

Copies of all high resolution 3D data are retained.
