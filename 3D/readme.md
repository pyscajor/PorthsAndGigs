## 3D models derived from 3D survey

Photogrammetry (Structure from Motion - SfM) surveys were undertaken at the following sites. Photos were processed using Agisoft Metashape. The 3D models have been decimated to a resolution suitable for disseminating via Sketchfab and GitHub.

3D models are in Wavefront *.obj* format and contain a texture file in JPEG *.jpg* format. These are compressed into a Zip file. These files should open or import into most 3D software.
