## Archaeology of the building of pilot gigs

The traditional design of gigs, evolved in Scilly and Cornwall, was particularly suited to running into a head sea, helping pilots reach sailing ships driven on the prevailing westerly winds. It was developed further by Cornish master builder William Peters in the early 19th century at Polvarth, St Mawes. Peters made all the historic gigs preserved on Scilly (mostly taken to Newquay and restored c.1954), and many more formerly kept on the islands. He also supplied to Newquay in 1838 the gig _Treffry_, whose lines are used as the model for racing gigs today (**Photo 1**).

In the foreground, the yellow gig Slippen, the green gig Bonnet, the white and blue gig Trefrry, the orange and white gig Golden Eagle, and the red gig Newquay are lined up. More small boats and sailing vessels float in the harbour, with a stone harbour wall, rocky cliffs, and houses overlooking the scene under a bright blue sky.](website-images/Gig-building/1-gigs-newquay-harbour-1956-trimmed.jpg)

Pilot gigs were also built on St Mary’s; in addition to sailing ships, dozens of which were commissioned and operated by owners on Scilly in trading ventures around the world in the mid-19th century. One shipyard, taken on in 1875 by William Gluyas (1841-1923) from his uncle William Mumford, lay above Town Beach opposite his uncle’s Lyonesse House on Lower Strand.

Traces of Gluyas’ yard are visible at Holgates (named after a later hotel that once stood here) where gigs are stored annually for the racing championships. An 1862 map shows the wall against an alley, at the townward end of Holgates Green, that once formed one side of shed in the yard (**Photo 2**). Gluyas built a gig in 1877 for St Mary’s coastguards, the _Klondyke_, conserved in Scilly’s Museum collection (**Photo 3**). Plans for restoration and display of Klondyke as part of a renewed museum and cultural centre are now in development.

_Klondyke_ was sold to St Agnes for lighthouse tendering work. Sheds where she was kept at different times survive as walled platforms, at Porth Conger. They lie either side of the road, downhill from the present _Shah_ shed (thanks to Marigold Hicks for information) (**Photo 4**).

More recently, Tom Chudleigh used a converted glasshouse in a yard behind the Strand, on Wellcross Lane, to build racing gigs for Scilly (**Photo 5**). These include St Mary’s _Serica_ (1967) ─ using lines of the old gig _Bonnet_, as noted by Alfred Jenkins ─ and St Martin’s _Dolphin_ (1969).

At St Mary’s present boatyard, at Porthloo, parts of old gigs replaced during past repair work are preserved by Andrew Hicks (**Photo 6**). Thanks to Andrew, a selection of these pieces was included in the _Porths and Gigs_ scanning and modelling work.

Pieces from pilot gigs were preserved by other builders too, notably Ralph Bird of Devoran. St Agnes’ new racing gig, _Cetawayo_ **link to Peraskin page** has laminated wood conserved from a different old gig, recorded by name, fitted in each section (builder Patrick Bird, pers. comm.).

Archaeology could reveal more about gig building and their materials, predominantly elm (**Photo 7**). Their age could be investigated by tree-ring pattern dating or by oxygen isotope analysis (Cathy Tyers, Historic England, pers. comm.). Elm cut for boatbuilding is sometimes found buried in mud, in the Fal estuary near St Mawes. Gig builders, like the Peters, would season timber in the creeks for 4 or 5 years. On Scilly, archaeological remains of gigs themselves could potentially survive, through burial in sand, for example. As historic maps show, sites of many gig sheds now lie under dunes, like a whole group on the west of the green at Periglis, St Agnes.

![Large felled elm tree trunks with rough bark and freshly cut ends lie on the ground at a boatyard. In the background, several moored boats, including a red and blue vessel, are lined up alongside a white building and green shrubbery under a bright blue sky.](website-images/Gig-building/7-porthloo-boatyard-elms-may-18-2024.jpg)

_7: Elm from St Mary’s Holy Vale, at Porthloo boatyard, showing its dense grain; elm was once prolific on the Roseland, where most of the old gigs now surviving on the islands were built._

An exciting recent discovery, at St Agnes, is part of a gig used as panelling in a house (thanks to Harry and Tamaryn Legg). Harry has identified the piece as probably part of the gig _Bee_, apparently based on St Agnes by 1841 when she went out to the fatal wreck of the _Thames_ on the Western Rocks (as recorded by Alfred Jenkins). The early elm planking and paint of the piece have great archaeological potential (**Photo 8**). It may be that more remains of this kind survive, in other contexts, since re-use and adaptation of material is a strong island tradition.
