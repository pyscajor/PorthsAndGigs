![A 19th-century oil painting of a coastal scene with a newlywed sailor and his bride near thatched gig sheds. They sit among fishermen and family, with others preparing food by a fire. The rugged shoreline, stone walls, and boats evoke a maritime community’s daily life, rich in detail and storytelling.](website-images/a-sailors-wedding-party-1862-james-clarke-hook.jpg)

The painting shows gig sheds at Point near the quay at New Grimsby on Tresco, before they fell into ruin, with typical thatched roofs and slipways. Thanks to Graeme Kirkham formerly of CAU for bringing attention to the painting and establishing its date.*
