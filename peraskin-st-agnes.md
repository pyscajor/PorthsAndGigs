# Peraskin (Porth Askin), St Agnes
## A whole base for pilotage on an outlying porth

This cove (pronounced ‘Per_askin_’) lies on Wingletang Down, at the wild south-western tip of the inhabited islands of Scilly (**Photo 1**). Its Cornish place-name may mean ‘porth of the sedge grass’ (Oliver Padel, pers. comm.). It is eroded by the massive seas from the west, but undisturbed, the main modern change being growth of low scrub.

The project has created a plan (**Photo 2**), and a 3D model, of the whole porth here, with the help of the islands’ Community Archaeology Group in reducing bracken and bramble cover, and with the assistance of volunteer surveyor Teän Roberts of Scilly. 

An outstanding complex of archaeological remains, still visible on the surface, shows that the par (the Scillonian word) or porth was used as a base for gigs, potentially all through the great era of pilotage from the 17th to the early 20th centuries. There are ruins of five gig sheds, placed here for proximity to the hazardous Western Approaches. (As old maps show, around 1800, as today, the nearest hamlet was Higher Town, half a mile away across the open down.)

The shed walls show on the ground as earthworks, that is, as banks of sand and turf, some with stonework still visible (**Photos 3**-**5**). There may once have been even more sheds. The shore has become eroded back, and shrouded in small sandhills, especially on the south east.

Three sheds, a single one and a pair, are Scheduled Monuments, meaning they are protected by law as well as by the community ─ some of the islanders are direct descendants of the pilots. Despite this, the monuments are threatened by coastal erosion and sea level rise, gradually advancing.

The plan and models help uncover details of the site, while it still survives, evoking what it was like to work gigs here. Trackways through seaweedy stones emerge on ebb tides, revealing the routes the crews took to carry gigs at low water, walking on the bed of the sea (**Photos 6**-**8**).

Peraskin was used to house the _Cetewayo_, the fastest gig on Scilly in her heyday around the time of Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee of 1887_._ She was built by Peters of St Mawes to work in St Ives, but was subsequently bought by St Agnes pilots and kept here until broken up after winning a regatta in the early 20th century, as Alfred Jenkins records.

The name of the old _Cetewayo_, also given to St Agnes’ latest gig, built by Patrick Bird (**Photo 9**), is that of a Zulu King, celebrated in Britain in 1882. Cetewayo, or Cetshwayo kaMpande, was King from 1872 of Zululand in present-day South Africa. In 1879, 24,000 Zulu warriors routed British forces but were soon defeated, and Cetewayo was held captive in Cape Town, in a conflict widely seen as unjustly pursued by Britain.

In 1882, however, King Cetewayo was permitted to visit London for several weeks. On August 4th he landed at Southampton and travelled by train to reside at 18 Melbury Road, Kensington, now marked by one of English Heritage’s Blue Plaques. The King was hugely popular, and gained the respect and support of several leading British statesmen (**Photo 10**). Crowds followed and cheered him as he negotiated his reinstatement. He returned to Zululand in 1883, but further turmoil there, and possibly treachery, led to his death in 1884 after which his young heir Dinizulu was proclaimed king. (Information from the Blue Plaques website.)

Cornish newspapers reported that Cetewayo arrived from Cape Town on the _Arab_, a 350 foot steamer. On August 3rd before reaching Southampton, _Arab_ touched at Plymouth early in the morning, after a rough run from Madeira and through the Channel in a severe gale. People crowded to Plymouth to see the powerful figure of Cetewayo, who sat on deck with his chiefs. He wore, at that time, a pilot coat (_West Briton and Cornwall Advertiser_, August 10 1882, 3; _Cornubian and Redruth Times_ August 11 1882, 4). On his departure, the King left from Plymouth, again in a gale, on the _Nubian (op cit,_ September 8 1882, 6), a steamer very like the _Arab_.

Possibly the Agnes gig was named for Cetewayo after her crew provided pilotage to the King’s steamer, or one of their number encountered the scene in Plymouth after serving another ship. 

Islanders will have known Cetewayo by reputation also. Admiral Sir Housten Stewart, Commander-in-Chief of Devonport, took the King in his yacht _Vivid_ to see a gunnery ship and factory before he left Plymouth (_ibid_). The following month the Admiral promoted to flag-lieutenant A.H. Smith Dorrien, of the Tresco family, specifically for his services in the Zulu War (_Cornishman_, October 19 1882, 5).
